# TartarusBot

Summoned from the depths of Greek mythology, TartarusBot is no ordinary Discord botâ€”it's the warden of your server's underworld. Inspired by the ancient abyss where the Titans were imprisoned, this bot ensures no mischief goes unpunished. Built using `modbot.py`, TartarusBot combines playful theatrics with powerful moderation, delivering scheduled timeouts and custom commands worthy of the gods themselves.

## Features

- **Scheduled Timeouts**: Automatically times out a specified user daily at a set time.
- **Manual Timeout Command**: Manually trigger a timeout for a targeted user with the `&manual_timeout` command.
- **Customizable Messages**: Sends dramatic, themed messages before timing out a user.
